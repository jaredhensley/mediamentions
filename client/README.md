# mediamentions client

React + Vite SPA built with TypeScript and MUI. This workspace is isolated from the backend to avoid `package.json` conflicts.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start dev server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes
- Update API URLs and environment variables to point to the backend (mentions, press releases, publications, Excel export endpoint, etc.).
- Run frontend commands from this directory to keep backend and frontend dependency trees separate.
